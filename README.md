# Drum Machine

## Description

The **Drum Machine** is a React-based web application that allows users to play drum sounds interactively. Users can trigger sounds by either clicking on buttons or using specific keyboard keys. The application features two sound banks, adjustable volume, and a power toggle, making it a versatile and fun tool for both casual users and music enthusiasts.

## Features

- **Interactive Drum Pads:** Click buttons or press designated keys (e.g., Q, W, E) to play drum sounds.
- **Two Sound Banks:** Switch between the "Heater Kit" and the "Smooth Piano Kit" for different drum sound sets.
- **Volume Control:** Adjust the playback volume with a slider.
- **Power Toggle:** Turn the drum machine on or off to disable sound playback.
- **Visual Feedback:** Buttons provide visual activation feedback when clicked or triggered by the keyboard.
- **Keyboard Compatibility:** Use your keyboard to play sounds for a more immersive experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the interactive user interface.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive and clean styling.
- **JavaScript**: For handling sound playback, keypress events, and user interactions.
- **CSS**: For custom styles and animations.

## How It Works

1. **Play Sounds:** Click on any drum pad or press the corresponding keyboard key to play a sound.
2. **Switch Sound Banks:** Use the sound bank toggle to switch between two sets of sounds.
3. **Adjust Volume:** Use the volume slider to set your preferred sound level.
4. **Turn Power On/Off:** Use the power button to enable or disable sound playback.
